# FileDB-GUI
A simple user interface for anno-mods/FileDBReader

I will upload an actual release (rather than just the source code) later, once I figure out how to do so.

For now, to use the program, I recommend:

* Install PyCharm community edition
* Clone this project into PyCharm
* Install the following packages: imgui, GLFW, PyOpenGL, and numpy
